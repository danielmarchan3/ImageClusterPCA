# Clustering Classes PCA

This project performs clustering of 2D images based on their similarity using PCA. The program processes images, applies clustering techniques, and visualizes the results.

## Features:
- Image preprocessing
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Image alignment with SSIM scoring
- Cluster visualization with t-SNE

## Requirements:
You can set up the environment using the following Conda command:

conda env create -f environment.yml

Alternatively, you can use `pip` with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage:
Once the environment is set up, run the program with:

python clustering_classes_pca.py

This will execute the clustering process and produce visualizations of the clusters.
